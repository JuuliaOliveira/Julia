Hello, Welcome!
My name is Julia, I'm an Agronomist born and raised in Brazil,graduated at the University of Brasilia and now starting my Master's degree in the US.
I've enriched my knowledge by doing a trainee in a horticultural farm and in ornamental flowers greenhouse back in 2020, and also working for an Agricultural Company in Brazil, now I'm excited to get an upper level degree and learn things that maybe I wouldn't in my home country.
With my experience being said, I'll finish my introduction saying that Agriculture is a gigantic field of study, so if any of you is interested in a part of it, it's worth trying and getting to know all the good that can bring for people and the innovations that make it more sustainable.
SUSTAINABILITY.... That's the GOAL!
